# HitBet-Football-Prediction-Application
app.py as the main Flask entry point — clean and obvious.

Config and environment-related files (config.py, requirements, dependencies.md) grouped at root — easy to find.

models.py for core model definitions, plus a separate models/ folder with different ML models and DB models, keeps things logically separated.

repositories/ directory fully organized by type — keeps your data access layer modular and easy to manage.

services/ folder dedicated to business logic, ML prediction, data services — great separation.

templates/ and static/ folders in the standard Flask way, which will be familiar to other devs.

utils/ folder for helpers and feature engineering — good place for reusable code.

database/ folder clearly organized for persistent storage and checkpoints, with .gitkeep files ensuring folder presence in git.

cache/ folder for caching — nice for performance optimization.
